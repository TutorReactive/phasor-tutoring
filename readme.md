##How to run
1. Install node js (https://nodejs.org/)
2. In the folder with Gruntfile.js open up a command prompt or terminal
3. Type "npm install" or "npm install grunt grunt-contrib-connect"
4. type "grunt connect:server" when complete

##Student progress
1) Hazel has finished the tilemap but couldn't get grunt to work last week so couldn't really progress
maybe check out 'npm install http-server' then 'http-server [path] [options]'
2) Kevin is killin it, he has many levels, the ability to change levels and bad guy movement + custom sprites and a spring board thing he made
3) The two others missed week 2 & 4 so have just finished the folder 1), I think we shouldn't make them do tile sheets because it might be a bit to much.  Work on class-ifying enemies, bullets or whatever

##TODO
1) students asked for power ups and stuff, could give bullets gravity (like super mario fireball)
2) refine when bullets delete (right now it's when they leave a hard coded ammount but try and make it if they collide with the camera)
3) give players health and variables for speed etc
4) BOSSFIGHT!
5) New enemies new behaviour
